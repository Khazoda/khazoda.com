**⚠️ Please Read First**

- Item models in Vanilla Minecraft have visible gaps in versions **up to and including** 1.21.10. Mojang has fixed this bug in 1.21.11 ([MC-73186](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-73186)).
If you're playing on a version before that, I strongly recommend using the
  **[Model Gap Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modelfix)** mod.
- Minecraft 1.21+ has a bug ([MC-271840](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-271840)) that
  stops damage increase enchantments (like Sharpness and Might) from showing the damage increase in
  a weapon's tooltip. Hopefully this bug is fixed soon.

# About

Basic Weapons adds **6** new melee weapon types of every vanilla tool material to complement the
existing sword and axe in Minecraft. Each weapon is balanced around damage, attack speed, crafting
costs, attack reach and special effects.  
_If you have Better Combat installed, the weapons are also balanced around number of enemies hit and
combos._

![Divider](https://github.com/Khazoda/basic-weapons/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/showcase.png?raw=true)
Weapons should feel _unique, powerful, easy to use_ and _fair._ I made Basic Weapons because I was
looking around for weapon mods that would fit seamlessly into vanilla gameplay, and didn't quite
find what I was looking for. I hope that in creating Basic Weapons, I've made that search a little
easier for those of you who've had a similar experience.

This high level overview should give you an idea of what each weapon is good and bad at:

| Weapon        | Damage | Speed     | Baseline Effect      | Reach     |
| ------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Vanilla Sword | Medium | Medium    | Sweeping             | Medium    |
| Vanilla Axe   | High   | Slow      | Shield Break         | Medium    |
| Dagger        | Low    | Fast      |                      | Medium    |
| Club          | High   | Slow      | Slow target          | Medium    |
| Hammer        | High   | Very Slow | Knock target upwards | Medium    |
| Spear         | Medium | Medium    |                      | Very High |
| Quarterstaff  | Low    | Medium    | Sweeping             | High      |
| Glaive        | High   | Very Slow | Sweeping             | High      |

# Material Pack System

Do you want compatibility with another mod's material? Check the
[Public Material Pack List](https://www.khazoda.com/basicweapons/materialpacks/list) to see if a
material pack for that mod has been created.  
If it doesn't exist? No problem! You can create materialpacks yourself with the
[Material Pack Creator](https://www.khazoda.com/basicweapons/materialpacks) web application, and
submit them to the public list if you wish.

Material Packs are loaded at the start of the game from the <kbd>basicweapons_materialpacks</kbd>
folder in your Minecraft root directory. Make sure you add packs before loading the game up, if you
add them after, they won't load. **Treat them as if they are mod files rather than resource or datapacks.**

# Mod Integrations

Basic Weapons can be enhanced by installing other mods alongside it. The following are mods that
Basic Weapons has built-in support for.

## Bronze

My [Bronze mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/bronze) adds bronze basic weapons automatically when both
mods are installed together. No material pack required.

## Better Combat

![Better Combat + Basic Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/basic-weapons/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bettercombat.png?raw=true)
Basic Weapons works well as a drop-in mod to spice up the weapon variety in your adventures, but it
plays especially well when paired with [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat).

With Better Combat installed, quarterstaves receive exciting new attack combos, daggers and clubs
can be paired with other weapons for dual-wielding mayhem, and the hammer even features a fully
custom attack animation.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, I recommend you try the two mods out together.
[Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat) can take some getting used to at first, but
it's well worth your time investment in the long term, bringing a new layer of strategy and fun to
your weapon choices and fights.

For weapon stats with Better Combat integration, see below:

| Weapon        | Damage | Speed     | Baseline Effect      | Targets | Reach     | Weapon-Type |
| ------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Vanilla Sword | Medium | Medium    | Vanilla Sweeping     | Multi   | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Vanilla Axe   | High   | Slow      | Vanilla Shield Break | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Dagger        | Low    | Very Fast |                      | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Club          | High   | Slow      | Slow target          | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Hammer        | High   | Very Slow | Knock target upwards | Single  | Medium    | One-handed  |
| Spear         | Medium | Slow      |                      | Single  | Very High | Two-handed  |
| Quarterstaff  | Low    | Fast      | Vanilla Sweeping     | Multi   | High      | Two-handed  |
| Glaive        | High   | Very Slow | Vanilla Sweeping     | Multi   | High      | Two-handed  |

# Frequently Asked Questions

**What does the "Might" enchantmenet do?**

```
Might functions exactly the same as vanilla Sharpness.
It increases the damage of your weapon by a flat amount based on the enchantment level.
I felt that blunt weapons having Sharpness didn't make much sense, hence Might.
```

**What are the recipes?**

```
Recipes are unlocked in the vanilla recipe book
when obtaining the requisite materials (e.g. picking up an iron ingot).
You can also use a mod like EMI to view all recipes.
```

**What are the mod's dependencies?**

```
Basic Weapons has no extra dependencies, just plug and play!
```

**Is there a neoforge/fabric/quilt version?**

```
Basic Weapons officially supports Neoforge & Fabric. If you're running Quilt, use the Fabric jar.
```

**Can you backport the mod to Minecraft 1.X.X?**

```
Unfortunately I don't have the time to backport Basic Weapons to earlier versions.
The mod will however support new 'major' versions of Minecraft. 
```

##### Check [This handy table](https://www.khazoda.com/versions) to see what I count as a 'major' version

**I found a bug / my game crashed**

```
If you find any problems with Basic Weapons, please feel encouraged to create an issue on the GitHub repository issue tracker.
Bug reports are incredibly helpful, and help make Basic Weapons the best it can be.
