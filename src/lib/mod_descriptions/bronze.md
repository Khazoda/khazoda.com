**Bronze aims to be the most vanilla-friendly bronze mod available for modern Minecraft.**

Bronze is made from copper and tin. Tools and Armour crafted with it are **better than iron** but
**worse than diamond**.

![Getting Started](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_getting_started.png?raw=true)

<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/gifs/mining_tin_cut-optimized.gif?raw=true">

### Your first step is to gather some raw tin and copper.

You will need 1 <kbd>Raw Tin</kbd> and 3 <kbd>Raw Copper</kbd> for every <kbd>Bronze Ingot</kbd> you
want to make.<br/>Craft 3 <kbd>Raw Copper</kbd> with 1 <kbd>Raw Tin</kbd> in a crafting window to
obtain <kbd>Bronze Blend</kbd> - then smelt this item in a furnace to obtain a <kbd>Bronze
Ingot</kbd>.

With your new bronze ingot, a new material tier opens up to you. Read on to find out about all the
wonderful things you can make with bronze.

<!-- BRONZE ARMOR SECTION -->

![Bronze Armor](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_armor.png?raw=true)

### Armour Strengths

<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/trimming_features.png?raw=true" alt="Trimmable bronze armor items">

#### Bronze armor is a tier slightly above iron and below diamond.

Most pieces have the same armor value as iron, but sport 2 distinct benefits over iron:

- Bronze armor has ~16% more durability than iron
- All bronze armor pieces have
  [`+1 Armor Toughness`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Armor#Armor_toughness).
- The bronze chestplate has one more armor point compared to iron

Crafting bronze armor is the same as crafting iron armor, but using Bronze Ingots instead of Iron
Ingots.

### Armour Trims

Bronze armour fully supports Minecraft's armour trimming system. Mix and match colors for the
perfect set of armor.

Since version 1.0.11+1.21, it's also possible to customize your armour using tin and bronze ingots
as trimming materials.

You are able to trim any modded armour as long as it supports vanilla's trimming system. Check out
the gallery for some modded armour with tin and bronze trims.

<img style="float: center;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/gifs/bronze_armor_trial_chambers-optimized.gif?raw=true" alt="Gif of player wearing bronze armor walking through trial chambers">

<!-- BRONZE WEAPON SECTION -->

![Bronze Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_weapons.png?raw=true)

The bronze mod ships with 2 weapons by default, the <kbd>Bronze Sword</kbd> and <kbd>Bronze
Axe</kbd>.<br/> These weapons have 100 more durability than their vanilla counterparts, with the
sword doing 0.5 more damage too.<br/> This means that the bronze sword is halfway between iron and
diamond in terms of damage, though the diamond sword has far greater durability.<br/> The bronze axe
on the other hand is on par with iron and diamond axes in terms of damage, but has slightly better
durability than iron, while having far less than diamond.

![Bronze Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/weapons_items.png?raw=true)

[Basic Weapons](https://modrinth.com/mod/basic-weapons) adds 5 other unique weapon archetypes, and
has explicit compatibility with the Bronze mod. Just install both mods, and the new bronze weapon
types will be able to be crafted!

<!-- BRONZE TOOL SECTION -->

![Bronze Tools](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_toools.png?raw=true)

### Bronze Tools are slightly better than iron, but much worse than diamond

As you may expect, this mod adds bronze variants of all vanilla tools. These tools have stats
similar to iron, but with some distinct benefits:

- Bronze tools have 350 durability instead of iron's 250
- Bronze tools are ~14% faster than iron tools
- Bronze tools have 0.5 more attack damage than iron tools
  ![Tools banner](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/tools_items.png?raw=true)

<img style="float: left;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/sickle_item.png?raw=true" alt="Sickle item">
This mod adds a new tool in addition to the 4 standard bronze tools - the <kbd>Sickle</kbd>.<br/>
This item helps you manage the flora in your world. It can harvest fully-grown crops on farmland as well as short and tall grass, leaving flowers and bushes intact.<br/>The <kbd>Sickle</kbd> is the perfect item for builders, who want to clear an area of land before building, as well as farmers, who will benefit from faster crop harvests and auto-replanting.<br/>Drops from blocks destroyed with the sickle are respected, so you will still get all those seeds from the grass you cut down.

#### Did you know: The sickle is in the same class as shears, compasses, clocks and the archaeology brush - it doesn't have different material tiers, and can subsequently only be made from bronze.

<!-- DECORATIVE BLOCKS SECTION -->

![Bronze Mod Decorative Blocks](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_deco.png?raw=true)

### Tin isn't just used to make bronze, It's a versatile building material too!

Have you made a full set of bronze weapons, tools & armour? Then it's time to put your surplus
materials to use and craft some of the decorative blocks included in the Bronze mod!

Chiseled tin, cut tin, stairs, slabs, connected tin framed glass and more building blocks await!
These materials would fit nicely into a temple or modern house build, and are also a great way to
show off your wealth! ⛏️

![Bronze Mod Decorative Blocks](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/deco_blocks.png?raw=true)

<!-- FUTURE PLANS SECTION -->

![Bronze Mod Future](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_future.png?raw=true)
The bronze mod has three main goals it aims to achieve:

- Give copper a whole new avenue of utility outside of redstone and building
- Flesh out midgame progression for survival Minecraft
- Add simple but useful features that enhance vanilla-centered gameplay

#### With this in mind, there are a few new features I'd like to implement in the Bronze mod going forward:

This mod already includes a few non-combat blocks and items, such as the `Bronze Door`,
`Bronze Trapdoor` and `Sickle`, but I believe there's room for more.
`Update: Since 1.0.11+1.21, a myriad of new tin-based building blocks have been added.`<br/>

Iron ingots have many different roles in vanilla Minecraft. They can be used for armor, weapons,
tools, pistons, chains, pressure plates and about 35 other recipes. While I don't want bronze to be
as useful as iron, as I believe it would take away from iron's mid-game dominance as a useful
material too much, I do want to add some unique features that round the material out.

To simplify this thought process:

- ❌ This mod **will not** hijack all of iron's recipes with its own versions, e.g. Bronze Bucket,
  Bronze Shears etc.
- ✅ This mod **will** come up with simple new utilities/blocks for bronze that don't feel out of
  place in the base game e.g. Sickle

Also, much like the Basic Weapons mod, I intend to update this mod with each new major version of
Minecraft going forward. If you've read this far, thank you! I hope you enjoy using this mod, and if
you have any queries/issues contact me via the mod's GitHub issues, via Discord or in the CurseForge
comments section🙂.

## Tin ore spawn levels

Open the section below to see the y levels that tin ore can be found

<details>

**Tin ore spawns between y levels `-42` and `64`, with it being most plentiful around `10`.**  
It spawns slightly less frequently than iron ore, and only between the values given, meaning it's
around 1.5 times more uncommon than iron ore (roughly).  
The best way to find it is by going caving above the deepslate layer, or by strip mining around y =
`10`
