**Bronze aims to be the most vanilla-friendly bronze mod available for modern Minecraft.**  
*Tin and Bronze are two new fully fledged materials with their own weapons, armour, blocks and more*

*Mix up your next playthrough with new sidegrades to copper and iron*

![Getting Started](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_getting_started.png?raw=true)

<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/gifs/mining_tin_cut-optimized.gif?raw=true">

### Your first step is to gather tin and copper
#### Tin Gear
Tin is a sidegrade to copper, being generally *more effective* but *less durable*.  
Tin weapons and armour are crafted with **`Tin Ingots`**, which are easily obtained by smelting **`Raw Tin`**.

#### Bronze Gear
Bronze is a sidegrade to iron, having *mostly the same* stats but *greater durability*.  
You will need 1 **`Raw Tin`** and 3 **`Raw Copper`** for every **`Bronze Ingot`** you
want to make.<br/>Craft these items together in a crafting window to
obtain **`Bronze Blend`** - then smelt this item in a furnace to obtain a **`Bronze
Ingot`**.

### Tin Armor

Tin is a sidegrade to copper, with some distinct differences:
- Tin armor's durability is exactly halfway between leather and copper
- Tin chestplates provide `+1 Armor` over copper
- Tin armor has 1 more enchantability than copper
- Supports armor trims

### Bronze Armor

Bronze is a sidegrade to iron, with some distinct differences:
- Bronze armor's durability is exactly halfway between iron and diamond
- All bronze armor pieces have
  [`+1 Armor Toughness`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Armor#Armor_toughness).
- Supports armor trims

<!-- WEAPON SECTION -->

![Bronze Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_weapons.png?raw=true)

The bronze mod ships with 4 weapons by default, the **`Tin Sword`**, **`Tin Axe`**, **`Bronze Sword`** and **`Bronze Axe`**.<br/> 

Tin weapons have 151 durability to copper's 191. All other stats are the same.  
![Tin Weapons](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/680a6aa34ea7821f6acd3418b9926476815a853d.png)

Bronze weapons have 500 durability to iron's 250. All other stats are the same.
![Bronze Weapons](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/7f2a0910ec889fe291ad7e1d433e1365fdc9fff0.png)

Another mod of mine, [Basic Weapons](https://modrinth.com/mod/basic-weapons) adds 5 other unique weapon archetypes, and
has explicit compatibility with the Bronze mod. Just install both mods, and the new tin and bronze weapon
types will be able to be crafted!

<!-- BRONZE TOOL SECTION -->

![Bronze Tools](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_toools.png?raw=true)

### Tin Tools
Tin tools have 151 durability to copper's 191, and 1 more mining speed. All other stats are the same. This puts tin tools at the same mining speed as iron/bronze
![Tin Tools](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/53ef624358a9124863d110fef67cd173f83049f8.png)


### Bronze Tools
Bronze tools have 500 durability to iron's 250. All other stats are the same.

### Sickle

<img style="float: right;" src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/a4b2220feb0f83019970c8de407dd0ef79554e5b.png" alt="Sickle item">

This mod adds a new tool in the same classification as Shears - the **`Sickle`**.<br>
This item helps you with the crops and flora in your world. It has different functions depending on *how* you interact, and *what* you interact with.
All these interactions are performed in an area with a configurable radius of 1-10, with the default being 4 blocks.
- Right Click
	- Crops: Harvests and replants fully grown crops, with a low chance per crop to give bonus useful items
	- Flowers: Plucks all flowers in the area, leaving everything else intact
- Left Click:
	- Grass: Cuts down all grass-like blocks, including tall grass, ferns etc. This action leaves flowers and other blocks intact.

**Adding blocks to tags**  
You can add blocks to the `#bronze:sickle_mow` and `#bronze:sickle_pluck` block tags to include blocks that the sickle can affect. Crops from other mods should automatically be detected, but if not, please open a bug report on Bronze's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/issues).

**Use Case**  
The **`Sickle`** is the perfect item for builders, who want to clear an area of land before building, as well as farmers, who will benefit from faster crop harvests, auto-replanting and bonus item drops.<br/>Drops from blocks destroyed with the sickle are respected, so you will still get all those seeds from the grass you cut down.

<!-- DECORATIVE BLOCKS SECTION -->


### Tin is a versatile building material!

Chiseled tin, cut tin, stairs, slabs, connected tin framed glass and more building blocks await!
These materials would fit nicely into a temple or modern house build, and are also a great way to
show off your wealth! ⛏️

<!-- FUTURE PLANS SECTION -->

![Bronze Mod Future](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_future.png?raw=true)
The bronze mod has ~~three~~ two main goals it aims to achieve:

- Flesh out midgame progression for survival Minecraft
- Add simple but useful features that enhance vanilla-centered gameplay
- ~~Give copper a whole new avenue of utility outside of redstone and building~~  (*1.21.10 finally gave copper the update it deserved!*)

#### With this in mind, there are a few new features I'd like to implement in the Bronze mod going forward:

This mod already includes a few non-combat blocks and items, such as the `Bronze Door`,
`Bronze Trapdoor` and `Sickle`, but I believe there's room for more.  
`Update: Since 1.0.11+1.21 - a myriad of new tin-based building blocks have been added.`<br/>
`Update: Since 2.0.4+1.21.10 - Tin armour, tools and weapons have been added`<br/>

Iron ingots have many different roles in vanilla Minecraft. They can be used for armor, weapons,
tools, pistons, chains, pressure plates and about 35 other recipes. While I don't want bronze to be
as useful as iron, as I believe it would take away from iron's mid-game dominance as a useful
material too much, I do want to add some unique features that round the material out.

To simplify this thought process:

- ❌ This mod **will not** hijack all of iron's recipes with its own versions, e.g. Bronze Bucket,
  Bronze Shears etc.
- ✅ This mod **will** come up with simple new utilities/blocks for bronze that don't feel out of
  place in the base game e.g. Sickle

Also, much like many of my other mods, I intend to update this mod with each new [*major* version](https://www.khazoda.com/versions) of
Minecraft going forward. If you've read this far, thank you! I hope you enjoy using this mod, and if
you have any queries/issues contact me via the mod's GitHub issues, via Discord or in the CurseForge
comments section 🙂.

<!-- ## Tin ore spawn levels

Open the section below to see the y levels that tin ore can be found

<details>

**Tin ore spawns between y levels `-42` and `64`, with it being most plentiful around `10`.**  
It spawns slightly less frequently than iron ore, and only between the values given, meaning it's
around 1.5 times more uncommon than iron ore (roughly).  
The best way to find it is by going caving above the deepslate layer, or by strip mining around y =
`10`
