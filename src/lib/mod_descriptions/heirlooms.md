# About
Unstackable crafted items get a special tooltip showing the **date** the item was crafted, as well as **who** crafted it.
Heirlooms gives your items a history which you can look back on fondly many years into the future.

### Hidden by default
The tooltip information is only shown when holding down the CTRL key while hovering over the item

### Supports modded items
As long as the item is made in a crafting table or a smithing table, or enchanted in an enchanting table, it should work, no matter the mod. Copper glaive is from [Basic Weapons](https://modrinth.com/mod/basicweapons)
![The tooltip for a copper glaive is shown, with [ctrl] and [alt] as buttons to press. There is another tooltip saying the item was enchatned by JuneMinecraft on 28th September 2025](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/a5b97e73cf269532505aa278de7bd32ea0eedfaa.webp)
