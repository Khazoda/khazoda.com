# About
The Heirlooms mod gives your favourite items a history which you can look back on.

### New Tooltips
Your unstackable crafted items get a special tooltip showing 
- the **date** the item was crafted
- the **name** of the player who crafted it.

### New Blocks
Heirlooms adds two new blocks, which are perfect for holding your favourite items and elevating their symbolic importance:

- Display Case - showcase your items in a glass enclosure
- Display Rack - show your items on a wooden rack

Both blocks show information about the item, including the tooltip information the mod adds, when a player looks at the block in-world.

# Tooltips
Any item that you craft which can't be stacked will receive an heirloom tooltip. Popular examples would include tools, weapons and armour.

### Hidden by default
The tooltip information is only shown when holding down the CTRL or ALT keys while hovering over the item

### Supports modded items
As long as the item is made in a crafting table or a smithing table, or enchanted in an enchanting table, it should work, no matter the mod.

### Display Case
The display case is a full-sized block and shows items on the wooden plate in the center.  
- Perfect for blocks

### Display Rack
The display rack is a small block and shows items at an angle.  
- Perfect for tools, weapons, armour

### Rendering Differences
The display case and rack render some items differently to each other. If an item is a block with a custom item texture (e.g. sugar cane, torch, sign) the display case will show the block model, while the rack shows the gui sprite:
