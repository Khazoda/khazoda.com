# About

**Plushables adds over 45 new plushies to that you can craft and display wherever you like. Check
them out in the [Gallery](https://modrinth.com/mod/plushables/gallery).**

This mod prides itself on offering a diverse mix of plushies that anyone and everyone can enjoy. The
primary focus is on a wide array of original designs and adapting animals that don't already exist
within Minecraft.

Plushables is always expanding. At the mod's inception in 2019 there were only 3 plushies. The list
is evergrowing, and constructive feedback and ideas are always appreciated.

# Getting Started

Finding any type of **flower**, a **gold nugget** or a **bottle of honey** will all unlock the
**Heart of Gold** recipe for you.  
Every plushable is crafted shapelessly from **one** wool block (of varying colour), **one** heart of
gold, and **one** other thematic item. Every recipe is unlocked in your recipe book once you craft
your first **Heart of Gold**.

# Collaborations

You might recognize some plushables from other mods. Those authors have been kind enough to allow
